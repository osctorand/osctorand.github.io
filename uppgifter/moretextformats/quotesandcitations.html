        There's much written on www about history of the <br> Internet. For example, about the first graphical Internet <br>
        browser on the web - Mosaic. <br><br> <blockquote>Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical <br> World Wide Web browser, released on April
        22, <br> 1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina. <br> A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape,
        which was released a year later.</blockquote> <br> <q>Today's Internet browsers we use today <br> (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome,
        Firefox, etc.), <br> got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.</q> This and much more can be found at <br><br> <cite>Who invented
