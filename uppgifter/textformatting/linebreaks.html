        In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee develops HTML, which made a huge
        contribution to how we navigate and view the
        Internet today.<br> Tim Berners-Lee introduces WWW to the public on August
        6,1991 and becomes available for everyone
        August 23,1991.<br>The World Wide Web (WWW) is what most people today
        consider the "Internet" or a series of sites
        and pages that are connected with links.<br> The Internet had hundreds of
        people who helped develop the standards
        and technologies used today.<br>Without the WWW, the Internet would not be
        as popular as it is today.
